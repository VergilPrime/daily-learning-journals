Day 15
I am super excited for our final project, I think it's going to be fun making something with so much math involved.
We are making a learning website for Blackjack. I'm a bit behind so I've been assigned some smaller tasks, but I have also volunteered to work on CSS for the entire website.
Can't wait to get started. Lots to do before Monday though!
