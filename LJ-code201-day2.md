# God help me I'm tired.
Seattle is so big! The commute to Codefellows is rediculous and I have to take public transportation.
Spent far too long trying to get the javascript error check thing installed, can never remember what it's called.
Need to get linux installed on my computer soon. I'm going to do my reading on the bus tomorrow morning.
