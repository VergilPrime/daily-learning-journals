### Like a truck
I'm not a big fan of the "everybody code along" lecture we did. It was a complex project and I definitely would have done it differently on my own, but I felt watching Allie work away as though we were spending too much time on the parts, and I didn't understand the whole.

I did end up completing the assignment, but one issue I ran into was not understanding some of the errors that popped up towards the end, because I didn't really know why all my gears weren't meshing together.

Had I had a better idea of the overarching design, I think those errors would have been easier to fix or would have never cropped up.
