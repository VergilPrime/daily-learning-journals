Can't let it be too easy
------------------------

Things were getting buggy so i spent the day testing new operating systems.
Linux still doesn't want to work with my hardware. Windows barely runs when installed on the hdd so i had to install it on my m.2 drive.
Basically I'm making very slow progress. Getting worried.
