# Regret
Visited home in Spokane over the weekend to tend to the house and take care of my cat.
Left my laptop there on accident, didn't notice till end of 5 hour drive to Seattle, 9PM Sunday.
Decided the only option was to drive back Monday. Missed class entirely, but was able to listen to most of lectures on return to Seattle.
Objects I think I've got down, not terribly worried. Could use some review on Methods and how they are implemented, but I'm not worried.
DOM sounds like it will be easy for me to catch up with as well.
Began lab from today but will have to work more on it tomorrow, sure I can catch up though.
