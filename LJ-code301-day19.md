### Slow but Steady

I think we've got this project in the bag. We definitely bit off more than we should have, but we all learned a lot and I am excited to see what I can do with this knowledge during break before 401. Google's API are really useful, I wish there were more free API out there to work with. Maybe I'll create some!
