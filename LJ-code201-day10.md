Day 10 was ideal for me. I had plenty of rest, plenty of pressure, and honestly i do my best work at the last minute.

I do wish things had been planned out a little better. We ended up getting 15 minutes for lunch between lecture and the presentation, the presentation went a little past 1:00 so we went straight from that into a four hour code-a-thon.

Still i suppose that's representative of the working world, so i guess it's not a big deal.
