### Easy Mode
SQL is something I have a lot of experience with. It's less flexible than objects in Javascript or associative arrays in Methodscript, so I don't prefer it, but I understand why it is so restrictive. Today's lecture was mostly review for me so I'm excited to get more SQL expience in the coming week.
