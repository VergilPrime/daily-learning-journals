# Progress
I'm starting to remember how CSS works. Beyond just how irritating it can be.
HTML hasn't changed much, but JavaScript is going to open up some cool things for me.
I just want to move beyond pop up prompts and text boxes. I'm sure we'll get there.

I also want to get into the swing of things with properly using Github, we're not really there yet.
